                                <p class="text-justify display-block">As a process improvement, I created a
                                    web application using python, Flask and SQLite that was hosted within the team.
                                    The idea was to generate rich interactive diagrams using data from runstreams, batch
                                    scheduler and programs. This website front-end was created using vis.js and jquery
                                    javascript libraries. I wrote multiple parsers to read runstreams, programs,
                                    database tables, copy procs and sub-programs and populated a graph object that I
                                    created. This graph object was then used to generate the nodes and edges for vis.js
                                    library based on the user query. Docker was used to create a container that is
                                    accessible by the team within the company network.<br><br>
                                    After regular use of the tool, other engineers
                                    in the team have requested me to add more functionality. Schedule was created to
                                    fetch the sources into the docker container on a regular basis.</p>
                                <p>● Easy UI to search for runstreams, programs and batch schedule <br>● Unified code

                                    and generated interactive diagram that could be used by the team to do impact
                                    analysis for future projects.<br></p>

                                    I created a tactical solution using python to extend personal loans to
                                    provide payment holidays for customers. Further I created another suite of python
                                    programs that used SQLite
                                    database to re-write loans that could not be extended further. The tactical
                                    solutions were used as a prototype to build the strategic solution on Unisys
                                    mainframe. I worked as a lead for this project, while writing few COBOL
