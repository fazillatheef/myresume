                                    reconciliation and analysis using Python (using pandas library) to further
                                    produce the high-level design. Pandas(python) was used to reconcile 4
                                    Million PANs across three systems. I also produced low level design for
                                    critical components and constructed proof of concept code for the
                                    development team. Also performed review for development and Test team
                                    artefacts. I worked along with another designer to provide summary of

                                    implement changes in a personal loan system.<br><br>As part of this project,
                                    I created a tactical solution using python to extend personal loans to
                                    provide payment holidays for customers while reducing impact on their credit
                                    scores. Further I created another suite of python programs that used SQLite
                                    database to re-write loans that could not be extended further. The tactical
                                    solutions were used as a prototype to build the strategic solution on Unisys
                                    mainframe. I worked as a lead for this project, while writing few COBOL
                                    programs and batch runstreams myself. From initial design to warranty
                                    support, I was involved in reviews and discussions with third parties like
                                    Experian, Transunion and other credit report agencies.</p>
                                <p>● Implemented a tactical solution very quickly to

                                    web application using python, flask and SQLite that can be hosted within the team.
                                    The idea was to generate rich interactive diagrams using data from runstreams, batch
                                    scheduler and programs. This website front end was created using vis.js and jquery
                                    javascript library. I wrote a multiple parsers to read runstreams, programs,
                                    database tables, copy procs and sub-programs and populated a graph object that I
                                    created. This graph object was then used to generate the nodes and edges for vis.js
                                    library based on the user query. Docker was used to create a container that is
                                    accessible within the company network. The tool was deployed to a docker container
                                    and was made available to the team. After regular use of the tool, other engineers
                                    in the team have requested me to add more functionality. Schedule was created to
                                    fetch the sources into the docker container on a regular basis.</p>

                                    and generated interactive diagram that could be used by the team to do impact
